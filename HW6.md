[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was using jQuery to manipulate elements across the whole web page. This is quite a general statement but for each phase, I was blown away at how easy it was to grab certain elements and change the data about them. Whether its changing the actual value of an element or adding a new data attribute to them, I found this facsinating.

The hardest thing in this assignment was using the ajax method for an asynchronous file upload. The instructions were quite clear, but I was still getting a error 500. This was a very general error and was hard to diagnose. After looking at the slides I realized I had to disable the inputs after the FormObject. This small fix solved everything and I was able to complete the rest of Phase 4.
