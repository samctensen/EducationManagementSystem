[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was using flexboxes for layout. Being able to manipulate flexboxes can help create fully customizable layouts. This seems very useful and I had fun learning and messing with columns and rows.

The hardest thing in this assignment was getting the collapsable margins and page to shrink when the page size is changed. This was very tricky and had me stumped for a while. Using the min instead of max really helped me so that I knew it would never be larger than 50rem. This was very tricky, but like the flexboxes, very useful with real world applications.
