- No one

[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was enabling the logins. I think this is incredibley useful for any website that uses any type of account. This was really cool to setup and django has awesome built in security features to lock pages until a login. I think this will be very useful in the real world because so much software is account reliant.

The hardest thing in this assignment was the first part of phase 4, setting up the different strings to display to a student depending on their submission. I think my solution is incredibly clean but probably not the expected result. Similar to previous assignments, I used a custom filter method in the views called from the template to return a different string. Once we had to add the link to the actual submission file, I had to change it up a bit. I did a little research on returning raw html from a filter and found the mark_safe method from django which can return raw HTML. So i built the paragraph and link tags in that filter method and returned them as one giant string.
