[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was building the form support in phase 6. Updating database values based on user input is very important to web design, and I had a lot of fun completing phase 6.

The hardest thing in this assignment was the profile section getting values for each assignment. I ended up creating a custom filter which checks for the date before spitting out the string fraction. I think I produced a very clean implementation with all of the logic being in the controller instead of the view.
