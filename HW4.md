Homework 4 Cover Sheet
----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [x] Phase 1
- [x] Phase 2
- [x] Phase 3
- [x] Phase 4
- [x] Phase 5

[x] I have checked that I did in fact update and push `DOMAIN.md`.

I discussed this assignment with:
- No One

[x] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was just the whole process of assigning a custom webpage to a website. This whole process was really interesting and I know that a lot of businesses use AWS to host their website so I thought this whole thing was very valuable.

The hardest thing in this assignment was just trouble shooting errors with AWS. I think I left out some important settings in my first instance and kept getting errors so I had to create a new one. With the second instance I was able to get everything right.
